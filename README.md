# number_pyramid
this program prints out a pyramid which height is based upon the number entered by the user<br/>
It prints out each line from 1 to the number and back down to 1 creating a symmetric line<br/>
The nuance i couldnt figure out was how to input the correct number of spaces to formulate this program<br/>
to look like an actual program.
